        <h2>About Balikpapan</h2>
          <p class="history">Balikpapan is a city in East Kalimantan which is the center of business, industry and has the largest economy on the island of Kalimantan, Indonesia. Famous for its petroleum and mining products, Balikpapan is located on the edge of the sea (seashore).It's best access in East Kalimantan with an international airport and port become the plus point for tourism. For the history session, Balikpapan originated from a fishing village on the edge of the Makassar Strait in the 19th century. The first drilling of oil wells in the city began on February 10 1897, which was later designated as the anniversary of Balikpapan. In 1907, Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij (BPM) established an office in this city, which was followed by an influx of investment from various multinational companies. The city's economy which is growing very rapidly attracts many immigrants and expatriates to Balikpapan. Today, Balikpapan has become a large, multi-ethnic city and is often named as one of the most livable cities in Indonesia.</p>

        <h2>4 Things that Make Me Proud of this City</h2>
        <ol class="proudCitizens">
          <li class="heading">Very Clean and Environmental Sustainability</li>
          <p>This city has received Adipura Awards 18 times. In 2013 and 2014, Balikpapan won the highest award as the Most Clean City from the Adipura Kencana Cup. For your information, Adipura Award is given to cities within Indonesia that're successful in cleaning and managing the urban environment. Some of the indicators include waste management, water pollution control and air pollution control. I think citizen's awareness comes from Regional regulations (perda) on cleanliness that quite strict, with fines being subjected to fines for disposing of garbage in an inappropriate way. Based on Perda no. 10/2004 a maximum fine of Rp 5 million or 3 months imprisonment. From here, the community character is formed.</p>
          <li class="heading">Traffic that aren't Like Other Big City</li>
          <p>No traffic jams, no crowding, nor filled with pollution. Balikpapan's traffic is the most comfortable for me to drive. If you order vehicle through an online app, the drivers are polite and love to chat with the passengers. Moreover, again, Balikpapan receive a receipt of the Wahana Tata Nugraha Award, which is an award from the Indonesia Government for a city that's able to organize public transportation well. From year to year as many as 18 times, Balikpapan has won this award, starting from 1992 to 2014.</p>
          <li class="heading">Rapid infrastructure development.</li>
          <p>if you leave here since you were kid, you will relize how rapid it's development even it's just a small town that rarely everybody know. Infrastructure improvements are carried out, such as repairing roads, public transportation, shopping centers, office centers, and so on. As a gateway to other areas in East Kalimantan, Balikpapan has the best infrastructure among other cities in the province. Even so, it still beautiful and green like the old days</p>
          <li class="heading">Conducive</li>
          <p>When I go to college at Surabaya, I started to compare Surabaya and Balikpapan. Yes it's true that Surabaya is a big city that has many failities and more modern. But if you're planning to built a family, Personally, I think Balikpapan is way better. This city feels calm, rarely heard of demonstrations. Even though it is populated by various tribes in Indonesia plus the proliferation of workers from outside Indonesia, this city is arguably safe and peaceful. In the official website of the Balikpapan City Government (Pemkot), it is stated that as of January 2015 the population in the city of Balikpapan has reached 706,414 people spread over 6 sub-districts.</p>
